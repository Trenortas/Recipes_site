    </ul>

    <h2>Cooking steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>In order to prepare doner, you need to prepare all the ingredients. This amount will make 2 shawarmas. 
            Mode: tomato into thin half rings, cucumber into rings. Mix mayonnaise with ketchup or tomato paste. 
            Finely chop the cabbage, add salt and mash with your hands. Chicken fillet finely and fry in a frying pan. 
            If you like it more spicy, you can add onion by cutting it into half rings. You can also make a sauce: squeeze 
            1 head of garlic into mayonnaise (3-5 tbsp), add 1 tsp. sunflower oil and mix everything well</li>
        <li>Lay out the pita bread. As in the photo, grease the edge with a mixture of mayonnaise and ketchup.</li>
        <li>Place cabbage on top of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Then add a few slices of cucumber and tomato.</li>
        <li>Now if you like onions, it's time to add a couple of rings. Place fried meat on top of the onion. 
            You can put a little garlic sauce on the meat.</li>
        <li>Folding the edges (you can only bend one) we roll the doner into a roll.</li>
        <li>If you like the shawarma to be warm and the pita bread to be crunchy, put it in the oven for 10 minutes. 
            Or fry in a frying pan. Before eating, grease the top edge with garlic sauce.</li>
    </ol>
